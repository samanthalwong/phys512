I've spent 2 weeks trying to debug this thing without success - my MCMC kept running away from the expected values for $n_s$, so at a certain point I figured it would 
be best just to get _something_ to run, so my `ps5.ipynb` and `ps5.pdf` files represent what I was able to run with a normal MCMC chain (5000 iterations for problem 3
and 100 iterations for problem 4)

I decided to do a last ditch effort to try to get it to work by constraining $n_s$ in my MCMC and ran for 10000 iterations each, so that's called `ps5_2.ipynb` and `ps5_2.pdf`
